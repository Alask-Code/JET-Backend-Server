languages can be loaded in 2 ways
1. less files -> loading locale.json in language folder and menu.json and languagefoldername.json for example en.json
2. more files -> loading "banners", "customization", "handbook", "locations", "mail", "preset", "quest", "season", "templates", "trading" as json files and then loading menu.json and en.json as folder name
